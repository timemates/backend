## Infrastructure: gRPC API Module

The `grpc-api` module provides gRPC server bindings and service implementations for handling remote procedure calls in the application.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the `grpc-api` module is to facilitate communication between client applications and the backend server using the gRPC protocol.

### Functionality

The `grpc-api` module includes the following functionality:

- **Proto Files**: The `src/main/proto` directory contains the protobuf files that define the service contracts and message structures. These files serve as the interface definition for the gRPC services.

- **Service Implementations**: The module provides implementations for the services defined in the protobuf files. These implementations handle incoming gRPC requests, execute corresponding use cases or domain logic, and return responses to clients.

- **Server Bindings**: The module sets up the gRPC server and binds the service implementations to the server. It configures the server with necessary settings such as port number and security options.

### Implementation Details

The `grpc-api` module utilizes gRPC frameworks and libraries to handle gRPC communication. It typically includes the following components:

- **gRPC Server**: Responsible for listening to incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate service implementation, and sending back responses.

- **Service Stubs**: Generated code that provides client-side representations of the gRPC services, enabling client applications to make remote procedure calls to the server.

- **gRPC Libraries**: Dependencies and libraries that provide required functionality for working with gRPC, such as serialization/deserialization, transport protocols, and error handling.

That concludes the description of the `grpc-api` module. It serves as an infrastructure layer for handling gRPC communication in the application.
